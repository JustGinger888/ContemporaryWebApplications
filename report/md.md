The practical outcomes for this unit are to create a responsive single page web-application (SPA) that supports Solent University students in some aspect of their day-to-day lives. To this end, over the course of two assessments you will use a data driven approach to identify a specific area in which students are being underserved and implement a prototype SPA to better serve students in your identified problem space.



Figure 1, The design thinking methodology, adapted from Interaction Design Foundation (n.d.).

Once again, in using the design thinking (DT) methodology as a lens (see Figure 1), this assessment represents the prototype and test phases of the overarching DT methodology. You will implement the prototype solution that you designed for the first assessment. Your implementation will be in the form of a single page web application (SPA).

#Deliverables
The source code of your solution should include a documentation.md file produced using valid markdown. This file should be 1,500 Words (+/- 10%) in length. While it is not a formal academic styled report, it should not be chatty. Furthermore, it should be produced using valid markdown. You are not required to use a reference list; however, you should try and justify your choices by linking to external papers and articles. You may link to the blogs of expert practitioners; however, do not use product or promotional blogs, these are very biased.

Your documentation.md file should, as a minimum, include the following sections

#Cover Page
Project Title
Name (student number)
Link to your hosted website
Link to your Git Repository, which should include a:
Professional README.md file
Your project's version controlled source files
#Introduction
This should pull together, and summarise, the entire project. You may, at this point, want to re-iterate the problem statement you derived in the first assessment.

#Methodology
You have already defined your overarching methodology, in assessment 1. For this assessment, you need to decide on a development methodology. It is important, what ever methodology you use, you adapt it to meet the needs of a small scale individual project (e.g. see, Dzhurov, Yani & Krasteva, Iva & Ilieva, Sylvia. (2009). (opens new window)Whatever methodology you choose it must be clear that you have used it. For instance, if you choose agile there should be clearly defined user stories and iterations. You can use the appendix to include items, such as, user stories.

#Methods
You will need to evaluate your solution with a representative user base. In this section, you will justify the data collection methods you used to conduct an insightful evaluation.

#Conclusion/Results
Given the limited word count, I recommend you combine these sections. You should, based off your results and reflective accounts, evaluate your solution.
